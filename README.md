## Logical Fallacies: A user generated repository of examples

[Client Website](https://alfredrafael.github.io/logical-fallacy-client/)
# Story of my logical-fallacies' website

A as a developer who taught elementary and high school, I am fascinated by philosophy and the ways in which it can improve our lives. To learn how to deconstruct logical fallacies in others' arguments, and IDENTIFYING faults in our own is a life-skill that can make our lives so much richer. By learning the terminology used to refer to certian logical fallacies, we become able to IDENTIFY them (in others, or even within our own heads) and therefore curve our behavior with a more productive and solid response.

The purpose of this website is to expose the user to these ancient vocabulary words, allowing him/her to identify logical fallacies in the future, and to allow users to provide their own examples.


## User story

- As a user, I can Log in and sign in into my account
- As a user, I can :
    - Study logical fallacies
    - Contribute an example of a logical fallacy
    - See other people's examples of logical fallacies
    - Delete / Edit my own example.

## Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS / SCSS / Bootstrap
- Javascript (jQuery + Handlebars)
- Ruby on Rails (Server side)

## WireFrame and ERD

This project's original wireframe (which was meant to be a test) can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/QSgmlz2). However, given time constraints I decided to structure my website as a resource for learning logical-fallacies + sharing examples with other users. While taking taking about the idea with Maria Peniche, we came up with [this](https://imgur.com/a/TKIguRq) ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) structure over lunch. 

## Unsolved problems

- I would like sign-in messages (and other notifications) to appear consistently, not only the first time the user use them (sign up success/failure, sign-in failure, and change password success/failure).

- I would like the "Create an Example" section, when accessed by the navbar, allow the user to see the h1 text: "Create an Example"

- I would like to provide the user with a modal to make changes to his/her existing index card

- I would like to provide the user with a search-bar that allow him/her to look for index cards based on:
     - Fallacy-name, 
     - Index card id number 
     - Text inside the index card. 


## Additional Resources

- I got my idea for fliping index-cards [here](https://codepen.io/myquite/pen/VjdvZY)
- I got my idea for the sign-in/sign-up section [here](https://codepen.io/elsharkawy00/pen/xqZEea)
